## Description of Project
In this project, we are going to digitize and upgrade Risk which is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest.
Our aim is to digitize this game by using the principles of object oriented programming.
The game is planned to be implemented in Java by using JavaFX library.

### What is RISK:
RISK is a multiplayer game, where each user has control of their army. Player's objection is surviving until all other opponents are destroyed or conquered. 

### Controls:
We are still considering our approach on how to implement a board game to a digital setting.

### Gameplay:
  Differing from the original game’s design we are planning on implementing an in game battle sequence to immerse the player more with the game instead of just showing the dice rolls.

  As the original game of RISK is more than 50 years old we assumed the rules and the gameplay has been refined to a state where the game is both fun and fair for all the players. Although we are still considering changes on the gameplay front we are considerate of breaking the delicate balance of RISK.
 
## Modifications
1. In game footage (battle scenes)
2. Different countries with individual starting bonuses instead of basic teams teams (clans, different symbols for each team)
3. Adding different maps to the game (Bilkent University map)
