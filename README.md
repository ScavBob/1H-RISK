## Description of Project
In this project, we are going to digitize and upgrade Risk which is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest.
Our aim is to digitize this game by using the principles of object oriented programming.
The game is implemented in Java by using JavaFX library.

### What is RISK:
RISK is a multiplayer game, where each user has control of their army. Player's objection is surviving until all other opponents are destroyed or conquered. 

### Controls:
Please refer to the in-game tutorial to learn about the Controls and How to Play.

### Gameplay:
  Differing from the original game’s design we are planning on implementing an in game battle sequence to immerse the player more with the game instead of just showing the dice rolls.

  As the original game of RISK is more than 50 years old we assumed the rules and the gameplay has been refined to a state where the game is both fun and fair for all the players. Although we are still considering changes on the gameplay front we are considerate of breaking the delicate balance of RISK.
 
## Modifications
1. Different countries with individual starting bonuses instead of basic teams.
2. Countries with different battle music and different UI elements, i.e. flags and colors.
3. Bilkent University map.
